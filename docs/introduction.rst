Mobility Intervention of Epidemics Challenge
======================


`Home Page <http://116.62.170.46:5000/>`_.

The challenge would like to gather the global research community to apply recent advances in data science and AI to generate new insights in support of the fight against pandemics like COVID-19. 

The challenge will be evaluated on a human mobility and epidemic transmission simulator. Participants will design different strategies to minimize the spread of the virus. The winners will be invited to present at the workshop.

Goal
--------------

In this challenge, we aim to look for effective human mobility intervention policies during an epidemic outbreak. Generally, our goal is to minimize the total number of infected people and, at the same time, minimize the intervention on human mobility.
