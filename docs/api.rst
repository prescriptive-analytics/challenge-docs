APIs

Simulation Initialization API
=====================

``Engine(thread_num=1, write_mode="append", specified_run_name="test", scenario="scenario1")``:

- Args: 

	- ``thread_num``: number of threads.
	- ``specified_run_name``: results saving folder name.
	- ``write_mode``: mode of saving simulation results, ``write`` will overwrite results from different rounds of simulation in the same ``specified_run_name`` folder, ``append`` will append the results from current simulation round to existing result files.
	- ``scenario``: the scenario to choose to run the experiment. Possible choices are ``scenario1``, ``scenario2``, ``scenario3``, ``scenario4``, ``scenario5``, and ``submit``. All other arguments will be invalid.

- Return: an initialized engine without ``reset()``, should call ``reset()`` after this function.



Simulation Config API
=====================

``reset(seed=False)``: 

- Reset the simulation, this should be called after we creat an engine with ``Engine()``
- Reset random seed if ``seed`` is set to ``True``


``set_random_seed(seed)``:

- Set seed of random generator to ``seed``
- Input format: int

``next_step()``:

- Simulate one step, a simulation step indicates one hour in the real world.


.. note::
	1. ``reset()`` should be called every time we creat an engine with ``Engine()``
	2. All the data acess/ intervention APIs should be called after ``next_step()``
	3. All the IDs for men and areas start from 0.


Data Access API
===============

``get_individual_residential_area(individualID)``:

- Args: individualID - id for individual
- Return: the ID of this individual's residential area.

``get_individual_working_area(individualID)``:

	The returned infection state is 1 when an individual is susceptible or pre-symptomatic.

``get_individual_intervention_state(individualID)``:

- Args: individualID - id for individual

``get_area_visited_history(areaID)``:

- Args: areaID - id for the area
- Return: a 2D list of the visited history of one area in past 5 days. Each of the inner 1D list represents the history for one hour. The order of the list is chronological, with the earlist time appearing the first in the list. Specifically, ``areaID=-1`` stands for hospital and isolation.
[[individualID1, individualID2, individualID3, ...], [individualID7, individualID8,]]


``get_individual_visited_history(individualID)``:

- Args: individualID
- Return: a 1D list of the id of the areas that he/she has visited in past 5 days. The order of the list is chronological, with the earlist time appearing the first in the list.
[areaID1, areaID2, ...].


``get_individual_visited_history_with_p_infection(individualID)``: (This API is deprecated.)

- Args: individualID
- Return: a 2D list of the probabilities of geting infected (from acquantaince contacts and stranger contacts) in the areas that he/she has visited in past 5 days. The order of the list is chronological, with the earlist time appearing the first in the list. This should be corresponding with  ``get_individual_visited_history``. 
[[p_acq1, p_stranger1], [p_acq2, p_stranger2], ...]


.. note::
	The calculation of the probability is based on the SIR model from this paper: 

	- William Ogilvy Kermack and Anderson G McKendrick. A contribution to the mathematical theory of epidemics. Proceedings of the royal society of london. Series A, Containing papers of a mathematical and physical character, 115(772):700‚Äì721, 1927.


``get_all_area_category()``:

- Return:  a dictionary with all area id as the keys, and the category of the area as the value, ``0: residential``, ``1: working``, ``2: commercial``


``get_area_contained_individual()``:

- Return: a dictionary with all area id as the keys, and the list of individualID who live in this area as the value 


``get_area_infected_cnt(areaID)``:

- Args: areaID
- Return: an int representing the number of infected (symptomatic and critical) people in this area


``get_life_count()``:

- Return the total number of people not in hospital of the whole environment.

``get_infect_count()``: (This API is deprecated.)

- Return the number of infected people in the whole environment.


``get_hospitalize_count()``:

- Return the number of hospitalized people in the whole environment.

``get_isolate_count()``:

- Return the number of isolated people in the whole environment.

``get_quarantine_count()``:

- Return the number of quanrantined people in the whole environment.

``get_confine_count()``:

- Return the number of confined people in the whole environment.


``get_stranger_count()``

- Return the number of stranger contacts.

``get_acquaintance_count()``

- Return the number of acquaintance contacts.


``get_current_time()``:

- Get simulation time (in hour)
- Return a ``int``, starting from 0

``get_current_hour()``:

- Get simulation time (in hour of day)
- Return a ``int``, ranging from 0 to 13

``get_current_day()``:

- Get simulation time (in day)
- Return a ``int``, starting from 0



Intervention API
===========

Intervention APIs are only effective when being called at the start of one day.

``set_individual_isolate_days(days_to_isolate)``: 

- Args: days_to_isolate 
	- a dictionary with individualID as key and days for each person to be isolated as value. The days should be positive integers (:math:`\geq 1`). If the value of day is smaller than 1, the corresponding individual to isolate 1 day.

``set_individual_quarantine_days(days_to_quarantine)``:

- Args: days_to_quarantine 
	- a dictionary with individualID as key and days for each person to be quarantined as value. The days should be positive integers (:math:`\geq 1`). If the value of day is smaller than 1, the corresponding individual to quarantine 1 day.

``set_individual_confine_days(days_to_confine)``:

- Args: days_to_confine
    - a dictionary with individualID as key and days for each person to be confined as value. The days should be positive integers (:math:`\geq 1`). If the value of day is smaller than 1, the corresponding individual to confine 1 day.

``set_individual_to_treat(if_treat)``

- Args: if_treat 
	- a dictionary with individualID as key and whether he/she is sent to be treated as value. Once set true, he/she will be staying in hospital for :math:`ùëáùëÖùê∏ùê¥ùëá` days (:math:`ùëáùëÖùê∏ùê¥ùëá=15`).

.. note::
    - When an individual is intended with multiple interventions, only the highest level of intervention will be applied.
    - When an individual is intended with multiple interventions at different days, the later intervention will update the older ones. For example, an individual is intended to be isolated :math:`N` days at the :math:`i`-th day. If later on day :math:`i+j`-th :math:`(j<N)`, he/she is set up to be confined, his/her intervention status will be updated to be confined, starting from :math:`i+j`-th day.
    - Intervention actions are only effective when being set at the start of one day.
